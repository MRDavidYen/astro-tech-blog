# The Collaboration focused Mock Server

## Motivation
First, I want to explain the motivation of this project.

I have been working on several projects that require a Mock Server to integrate with Front-end and Back-end.

Then, I use [WireMock](http://wiremock.org/) to create a Mock Server.

However, I am facing some problems with WireMock.
WireMock is a great tool, but unfortunately, it is not easy to collaborate with other developers when self-hosting WireMock.
1. If you does not use WireMock cloud service (which is not free), you need to host the WireMock by yourself.
2. There is no GUI to manage the Mock Server if you self-hosting WireMock. They only provides GUI for their cloud service.
3. Self-hosting WireMock does not provides database storage. You need to use file system to store the Mock Server data.
4. File system is not easy to maintain if you host it on Docker. You need to mount the volume to the host machine.

Then, I recognize there are many Mock tools that need to paid for collaboration features.
For example, [Mockoon](https://mockoon.com/) and [Postman](https://www.postman.com/).

Some of these tools provides self-hosting or free plan, but they usually have some limitations. (Even they are open-source)

According to the above problems, I want to create a Mock Server that can be easily self-hosted and collaborated with other developers for free and open-source.

Also, I inspired by [wiki.js](https://js.wiki/). Wiki.js is a great open-source KM tool that can be easily self-hosted and collaborated with other developers.

Wiki.js not only provides a great UI, but also provides widely databases support (PostgreSQL, MySQL, MongoDB, MSSQL, etc).

## Architecture
The Backend is written in Rust and the Frontend is written in Next.js.

The Backend is using Actix-web as the web framework and Diesel as the ORM.

I also follow the Clean Architecture to design the Backend. 
This is the example from Microsoft: [Microsoft Clean Architecture Example with Actix-web](https://github.com/microsoft/cookiecutter-rust-actix-clean-architecture/tree/main)

How the Clean Architecture in Rust looks like:
1. The customize `Container` that contains global states and dependencies for the application. like database connections, etc. (You can imagine it as DI container in other languages)
2. `Controller` layer that contains the HTTP handlers.
3. `Service` layer that contains the business logic.
4. `Repository` layer that contains the database operations.
5. `Domain` layer that contains the domain models.

Follow the Clean Architecture, We can easily maintain the code and test it.

I will discuss the backend Architecture details in future article.
