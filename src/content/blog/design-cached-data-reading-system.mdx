# Design of a Cached Data Reading System

## Intro

I am working on a E-commerce company, and the company has a lot of products with complex logics, stock level, price, sales.

We also need to make sure the performance of website is acceptable, so we need to cache the data in Redis.

## Situation
Our service mostly host on Azure.

1. Database: Microsoft SQL Server. The most expensive part of our system.
2. Cache: Redis. We use Azure Redis Cache with C2 tier. It provides 99.9% SLA.
3. Web Server: ASP.NET MVC. This is a legacy system, and we are implementing progressive enhancement to ASP.NET Core.
4. Product Service: The Core of this article. It is a service that manages the product data and Redis Cache.

## Limitation

Since we have a ASP.NET MVC website, it is not easy to implement a cache system.
